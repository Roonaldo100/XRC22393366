This repo will hold my XR Prototyping Project

Solar System Explorer
Project Proposal
By Ruben Kenny

I aim to create an XR environment in godot which allows the user to traverse our solar system.  They will be able to grab planets to interact with them and learn a fact about them. The user will be able to turn planet orbits on and off in order to catch up with planets more easily and observe the orbit patterns at their leisure. At the end of the experience, I would like to incorporate a small shooter section wherein the player fights off some incoming alien enemies. This will increase the user enjoyment of the experience and aims to make the experience more memorable overall

This project will address SDG4: Quality Education. Interacting with the planets in a virtual environment will help bring the scope of the solar system to life for the user by immersing them in virtual reality.

The project will not look to extend Quest:SDG. It will be a standalone project

I will be working as a single team member in this project
